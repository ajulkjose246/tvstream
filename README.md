## 🎯 Performance Optimization & Device Testing

### Performance Considerations

1. **Video Streaming Optimization**:
   - The app uses the `video_player` plugin for efficient video playback
   - Implemented HTTP overrides for certificate handling in development
   - Consider implementing video caching for better performance

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Dispose of video controllers properly to prevent memory leaks
   - Use appropriate image formats and sizes for assets
   - Implement lazy loading for large lists

3. **Network Optimization**:
   - Consider implementing retry mechanisms for failed video loads
   - Add loading indicators for better user experience
   - Implement progressive video loading

### Device Testing Recommendations

1. **Android Testing**:
   - Test on various Android versions (API 21+)
   - Test on different screen sizes and densities
   - Verify video playback on different hardware configurations
   - Test with different network conditions (WiFi, 4G, 3G)

2. **iOS Testing**:
   - Test on different iOS versions (iOS 12.0+)
   - Test on various iPhone and iPad models
   - Verify video playback performance
   - Test with different network conditions

3. **Web Testing**:
   - Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Verify responsive design on various screen sizes
   - Test video playback performance in browsers

4. **Desktop Testing**:
   - Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Verify window resizing behavior
   - Test keyboard and mouse interactions

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Check for outdated dependencies
flutter pub outdated
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- The app includes HTTP overrides for development purposes
- For production, implement proper SSL certificate validation
- Consider implementing content protection for video streams
- Add proper error handling for network failures
